Live Emotion Checker:
This program provides real-time emotion analysis using live video feed.
It places a dynamic square around your face and overlays your emotion, whether it's happiness or sadness, directly above your face.

Multi-Analyzer:
The Multi-Analyzer offers a user-friendly graphical interface.
When you initiate the program and click on "Start Analysis," it goes beyond emotion detection.
This advanced tool also attempts to determine your gender and approximate age (though keep in mind that age accuracy may vary).
Emotions are presented as percentages, such as 30% happiness, 10% sadness, and 60% neutrality.
